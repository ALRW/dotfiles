# DOTFILES

These are my personal dotfiles. They are and always will be a work in progress
:construction: so use at your own peril!

This assumes a new install on a mac and uses `brew` to manage software and
dependencies and stow to manage symlinking everything once complete

Make sure you can run the install script
```sh
chmod 777 setup.sh
```

Running the install script
```sh
./setup.sh
```
